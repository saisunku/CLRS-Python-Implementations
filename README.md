# CLRS-Python-Implementations
Python implementations of some algorithms from the CLRS textbook

#### Sorting (sorting.py)

- Insertion sort
- Insertion sort in non-ascending order
- Mergesort
- Heapsort
  * draw_heap() - a function that draws a visual representation of the heap - useful for debugging!
- Quicksort
- Randomized quicksort
- Counting sort


#### Randomization (randomization.py)
- random(a, b) - generates a random number between a and b using random(0, 1)
- Randomize an array in-place


#### Dynamic Programming (dynamic_programming.py)
- Rod cutting problem
  * Recursive solution
  * Top-down memoized solution
  * Bottom-up solution
  
- Longest common subsequence


#### Min priority queue (min_priority_queue.py)


#### Greedy algorithm for activity selection (greedy_activity_selection.py)

#### Huffman code for data compression (huffman.py)

#### Basic graph algorithms
- Breadth-first search (bfs.py)
- Depth-first search (dfs.py)
- Topological sorting of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) (dfs.py)

#### Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning tree (min_span_tree.py)

#### Dijkstra's algorthm for shortest paths (shortest_paths.py)
